<h1> DHONI</h1>
<p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw <b>Rahul Dravid</b> as the <mark>wicket-keeper</mark> to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in <u>batting talent</u> and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.[34] With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004.[35] Dhoni made his debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[36] Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[37] In the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[38] Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in Octoberâ€“November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[39] The <q>innings would surpass his earlier record</q> for the <del>highest score</del> by an Indian wicket-keeper and was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[40] It was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson.[41][42] Dhoni ended the series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.</p>
